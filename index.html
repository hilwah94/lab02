        At first I would like to welcome you to my humble website
        my name is Omar Hilwah im 26 years old
        and I used to work as an industrial automation technician
        what I like to present more about myself is my volunteer work
        as I now work for a charity for orphan children,   
        and perhaps one of my most important dreams is
        to establish an institution that cares for children
        in particular and that it has its own financial source and
        that it is not dependent on donations,
        My advice to you is to seize the beautiful moments in life
        and always try to do good, always do good</section>
